	<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	<p>M: Bond one of our men has confirmed the location of the hideout of our old mate Joe. Remember how he planned an attack into our headquarters? Well,
	he is hiding in a nearby territory with some of his fellow, well secured by arm guards. I order you to sneak into the hideout and hunt him down. But beware, his guards,
	they are dangerous. You have already lost substantial amount of your skills. Stay alert and get back safe.
	</p>
	<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
	<p>Make a vision guided bot to move through some goal points avoiding some moving autonomous enemy bots.<br />
	<b>Goal points:</b> These are some <b>green</b> marks that your bot needs to pass through.<br />
	<b>Guards:</b> Virtual <b>Red</b> Spots which moves in a straight line for some time, stops, rotates by a random angle and starts moving in another direction.<br />
	<b>Arena Boundary:</b> Solid Black walls and avoid hitting them.
	</p>
	<h3>TASKS</h3>
	<p>Start from a starting point, you will have to reach the goal points in any order avoiding the enemy bots.
	When you reach and leave a goal point an alert will be raised for 'x' seconds during the time the enemy bots will seek your current position and move towards you,
	all goal points will be closed down. After 'x' second everything will be restored to normal. Finally come out through an escape point.<br />
	<b>Level I:</b><br />
	1.	You have 2 goal points to pass through.<br />
	2.	You have to escape 1 Enemy Bot.<br />
	<b>Level 2:</b><br />
	1.	4 Goal Points<br />
	2.	2 Enemy Bot<br />
	<b>Level 3:</b> [will be held if required]<br />
	1.	You will have 6 Goal Point to pass through.<br />
	2.	You have to escape 2 <b>agile</b> Enemy bots.<br />

	<h3>Arena</h3>
	<img src="/assets/events/arena3.jpg" alt="Arena"/>
	<div></div>
	Physical Arena Dimension: 1.2m X 1.2m<br/>
	Virtual Arena Dimension: 500px X 500px


	<h3>Frame Feeding Process</h3>
	JPEG images of each processed frame will be provided to you over a network. They will be stored at some local folder in your computer wherefrom you can access them easily for your image processing and bot control.<br/><br/>

	We will be providing the images at a constant rate of 10 fps (files per second), ie. to say that to get the current position of the bot you need to wait for a time period of 0.1 sec.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Rules</h3>
	<h4>Event Rules</h4>
	<p>1. The Bot has to start 
	from region marked start.<br />
	2. The Bot will have to stay within the 
	Physical Arena Boundary. The entire arena will be mapped to the virtual arena. Hence, the edge of the images in the feed 
	provided will represent Physical Arena Boundary.<br />
	3. The team will have at most 3 TIMEOUTs and 2 RESTARTs. In case of timeouts, you get 5 minutes, the timer will be paused, and you can touch the bot 
	but can NOT move the bot significantly or change the direction it is heading. In case of RESTARTs the timer resets and all progress will be erased. Timeouts 
	and restarts bear huge penalties.<br />
	4. Arena Damage will lead to disqualification.<br />
	</p>
	
	<h4>Bot Specifications:</h4>

    1. If any wiring is used for communicating with the bot inside the arena, it should be dark in colour preferably black.<br/>
    2.Your bot should have a flat surface on the top to let us attach a marker over it.<br/>
    3.Your bot should not exceed the dimension of 15cm x 15cm x 15cm.<br/>

	<h4>General Rules</h4>
	<p>1. Teams need to be present during the spot registration.<br />
	2. A maximum number of participants allowed per team: 4 people.<br />
	3. Students from different colleges can also form a single team.<br />
	4. The participants will be provided with 220 Volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply. 
	Participants will have to themselves arrange for any other power supply required for their robot. <br />
	5. The participants can NOT touch the bot during runtime.<br />
	6. Robodarshan volunteers will assist participants in managing the wires.<br />
	7. LEGO kits are not allowed. <br />
	8. The decision of the Team Robodarshan will be final and binding. The rules are subject to change.<br />
