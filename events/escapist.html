	<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	<p>M: Bond one of our men has confirmed the location of the hideout of our old mate Joe. Remember how he planned an attack into our headquarters? Well,
	he is hiding in a nearby territory with some of his fellow, well secured by arm guards. I order you to sneak into the hideout and hunt him down. But beware, his guards,
	they are dangerous. You have already lost substantial amount of your skills. Stay alert and get back safe.

	all goal points will be closed down. After 'x' second everything will be restored to normal. Finally come out through an escape point.<br />

	from region marked start.<br />

	provided will represent Physical Arena Boundary.<br />
