<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>You have been placed in a maze and you have to get out of it. But checking every path takes a lot of time so the captors have decided to help you. 
The maze has letters and numbers in some of the turns to guide you in the correct direction.
It is now up to you to take correct turns and reach the exit. Beware of the night though as you can't see the numbers.
</p>
<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<p>Build an autonomous robot that can solve a maze with help from IR communication and wall following.
</p>
<h3>TASKS</h3>
<p>Build an autonomous robot that can-<br />
	1.Follow the maze using IR proximity/ Ultrasound sensor.<br />
	2.Communicate with the maze using IR remote control protocol (SONY) and follow the directions.<br />
	3.In case of dead ends, return and take the other path.<br />
	4.And finally, Reach the exit of the maze before time runs out.
</p>
<h3>Arena</h3>

<img src="/assets/events/maze_98_.jpg">
<p>1.The arena will be a grid of 10x10 sections, each section measuring about 1.5'x1.5'. Hence the arena will be a square of 15'x15'.<br />
2.The arena will be set up as a maze, with walls of thickness __(soon to be updated). <br />
3.The arena will have dead ends in some places.<br />
4.IR signal to guide the bot will be beamed from above.<br />
5.Not all intersections will have a guidance system. Only a crossroad ('A' in figure) will definitely have one. A 'T' section ('B' in figure) may or may not and a straight turn ('C' in figure) definitely WILL NOT have a guidance system. 
In case of a turn and a dead end ('D' in figure) there WILL NOT be a guidance system.<br />
6.The bot will have to start from one side of the maze and reach the other end to finish.<br />
</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<h4>Event Rules</h4>
<p>1.The Bot has to start from region marked start and get to the region marked finish.<br />
2.We will be using Sony's IR protocol to send hexadecimal codes corresponding to a direction. You have to successfully decode it. We will provide tutorials regarding this.<br />
3.The bot can take any path and we will see to it that different paths will have same points provided the bot has not taken a wrong turn.<br />
4.Wall hit will cost points.<br />
5.Correct turns will award points and wrong turns will penalize you.<br />
6.From the start of the run for _ minutes the guidance will be on. After this period is over guidance will be turned off. After this you will have _ minutes more to complete the event. If you complete the event in this state you get a bonus point.<br />
7.The team will have at most 3 timeouts and 2 restarts. In case of timeouts, you get 5 minutes, the timer will be paused, and you can touch the bot but can NOT move the bot significantly or change the direction it is heading. 
In case of restarts the timer will be resetted and all progress will be erased. Timeouts and restarts will bear huge penalties.<br />
8.The arena shown above is a sample only and the actual arena will be disclosed on the day of the event.<br />
</p>
<h4>General Rules</h4>
<p>1.Teams need to be present during the spot registration.<br />
2.A maximum number of participants allowed per team: 4 people.<br />
3.The participants will be provided with 220 Volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply. <br />
4.Participants will have to themselves arrange for any other power supply required for their robot. <br />
5.The participants can NOT touch the bot during runtime.<br />
6.Teams can manage wires provided they do not tamper with the position of the bot using Hand of God.<br />
7.LEGO kits are not allowed. <br />
8.The decision of the Team Robodarshan will be final and binding. The rules are subject to change.<br />
</p>
<h3>Robot Specifications</h3>
<p> The robot must fit in a box of 25cm * 25cm * 30cm with a tolerance of 10% in the dimensions of robot. 
No part/mechanism of/on the bot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event. However, the dimensions can change during the course of the run.
</p>
<h3>SCORING</h3>
<p> Each team will start with a base score of 1000;<br />
First correct 'A'* turn = +600;<br />
Every other correct 'A'* turn = +300;<br />
Every correct 'B'* turn = +400;<br />
Every correct 'C'* turn = +100;<br />
Every correct 'D'* turn = +500;<br />
Every wrong 'A'* turn = -150;<br />
Finishing the maze (guidance ON or OFF) = +1000;<br />
Finishing the maze with guidance OFF = +500 (extra);<br />
Every wrong 'B'* turn = -200;<br />
Every wrong 'C'* turn = -50;<br />
Every wrong 'D'* turn = -250;<br />
Every wall hit = -100;<br />
For every turn taken (correct or incorrect) = -100;<br />
Every Timeout = -500;<br />
Every Restart = -1000;<br />
