<p>It will comprise of two rows of obstacles in the form of gates .Show your dribbling skills as you pass across the "defenders".<br />
As you can see there are two rows of obstacles . Now the width of each gate is 50 cm.The gap between two gates is also 50 cm.
There are 3 gates in 1st row and 4 gates in 2nd row.(figure1)<br />
The 1st row of obstacles is 60 cm away from the starting line and the 2nd row of obstacles is 80 cm away from the 1st row of obstacles.(figure 2)
</p>
<h4>ZONE 2</h4>
		<img src="/assets/events/robopolozone3.jpg">
<p>This zone is free from any obstacles. There will be  3 balls placed at about 170 cm away  from the starting line  i.e. 30 cm away from the 2nd row of obstacles.
After you have succeeded to make a goal we will place another ball i.e. there will be three balls at any  instant in Zone 2.<br />
The goalpost will be 100 cm wide and 20 cm above  the water surface . There will be a red line surrounding the goal post .The red line is 8 cm away from the goalpost .
