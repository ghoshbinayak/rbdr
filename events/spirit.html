<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<h4>Follow anyone of them</h4>
<p><b>1)Using 2 bots :</b><br />
Build 2 bots; one capable of traversing a rough terrain, carrying objects, , climbing  an incline and depositing  them on the raised platform .
The 2nd bot needs to  traverse on two tracks raised above the ground placed parallel and at a constant height. The 2nd bot needs to  transport objects  
from the raised platform underneath  and  deliver them to the  victims stationed at rehabs.
</p>
<p><b>1)Using 1 bot :</b><br />
Build a bot which can traverse on  rough terrains , carry the objects , climb an incline and shoot the objects into the baskets at a certain distance away.
</p>
<h3>Arena</h3>

<h4>ZONE 1</h4>
<div class="row">
<img src="/assets/events/spiritzone1.jpg">
<p>
1.The brown line marks the starting line . The bot has to be placed behind it. <br/>
2.One can take any path. It is not compulsory to cover one terrain before the other i.e. there is no order of traversing the various terrains. <br/>
3.Each Terrain is 100 cm * 100 cm.
4.Though the height of each terrain is 3 cm , the water level will be about 1cm.
5.There will be a curved path at the beginning and end of each terrain so that the bot can easily cross from one terrain to another.
6.Each terrain will contain 2 food packets ( made of thermocol ) of 4cm * 4cm. There will be a total of eight food packets each of different colour. There will be no hook system attached with the food packets.
</p>
</div>
<h4>ZONE 2</h4>
<div class="row">
<img src="/assets/events/spiritzone2.jpg">
<p>It comprises of an inclined plane of 25 cm high and the base is 50 cm There will be a raised platform afterwards of 50 cm long .
The inclined plane and the raised platform is 200 cm wide .
</p>
</div>
<h4>ZONE 3</h4>

<img src="/assets/events/spiritzone5.jpg" style="float: left;width: 12%; margin-left: 10%;">
<div class="clear-fix"></div>
<p>There are two rail sections, 6cm wide and 200 cm long each .The rails are 36 cm above the ground. The gap between two rails is 18 cm. 
The rails are 8 cm above the raised platform .<br />There will be 8 baskets where the 2nd bot has to place the food packet in the respective coloured basket.
The basket will be of 28 cm high i.e. as the same level as the raised platform.

<h3>Rules</h3>
