ROBODARSHAN, the Robotics Society of Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (erstwhile, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur), was officially <b>founded in the year 2009</b> by a group of students with the intuition of inculcating the passion and zeal for robotics (which is an amalgam of nearly all branches of engineering) among the then aspiring engineers of this 158 year old institute. The club became an official part of <b>Centre for Creative Expression</b> for students and became fully functional in the year 2011 when the first workshop sessions were held. The first “Do it Youself” challenge was conducted in the year of 2012 to instigate the freshmen to get involved in robotics. Since then, the club has never looked back and has progressed with leaps and bounds. At present, the club operates in association with the <b>“Homi Jehangir Bhabha Student Innovation Centre”</b> and infuses in students the need of robotics and shows how robotics is closely related to our daily world and how they make our lives easier.
<b>HJBSIC-Robodarshan</b> is currently mentored by our eminent <b>Prof. Syed Minhaz Hossain</b> (professor of physics dept.) and has currently 27 core members besides, around <b>250</b> students(spanning all years) who weekly attend the seminars and workshops conducted by the club. Apart from bringing in new students to robotics, members of the club also work on their self-projects as well as on models to participate in the various annual technical fests of several institutes like IIT Kharagapur, Jadavpur University, NIT Durgapur, IEM Kolkata, etc.
 

The club would like to mention a few founders who had set the stone rolling for the years to follow:

*<b>Batch of 2013:</b> Prithviraj Nag (CST), Pikan Ghosh (CST), Souvik Sinha Deb (CST)*

*<b>Batch of 2012:</b> Sayontan Ray (CST)*

*<b>Batch of 2011:</b> Sumit Kumar Pramanick (EE)*

*<b>Batch of 2010:</b> Gaurav Konar (ETC), Koushik Sasmal (EE)*

And now being one of the most active club of IIEST Shibpur, we plan to expand and infuse robotics among every domain of our curriculum as we believe "There's nothing a bot can't do".
